# expletiveCheck

Feature: This is a Python program which compares known foul language against a list of dog breeds and reports if a potentially embarassing word has been detected.

A ReadMe was not included previously, so now this addresses that issue.

Resolves: This resolves the issue of not having a readme that follows style guides so that it serves to better explain the project.
